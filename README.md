This repository was created to be a request/bug tracker for Roll20 API scripts at https://github.com/Roll20/roll20-api-scripts

Anyone with a GitHub account can create issues, but those issues can only be assigned to collaborators.  If you are a script writer and want to be added as a collaborator, please contact manveti on Roll20 (https://app.roll20.net/users/503018/manveti).

When creating an issue, please assign one of the following labels if possible (unfortunately, GitHub only allows collaborators to set issue labels, so you may need to just mention it in the title or description):
 * bug: A crash or failure of an existing script to adhere to documented behavior.
 * enhancement: A request for new features to be added to an existing script.
 * new script: A request for an entirely new script to be written.

If you know the owner of a script for which you're reporting a bug or requesting an enhancement, please @mention them in the issue description (e.g. @manveti), which will cause GitHub to notify them of the issue directly.
